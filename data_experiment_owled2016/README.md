This directory contains all the data gathered in an experiment where we ask ten people with limited expertise in Semantic Web technologies and Ontology Engineering to use SAMOD for developing an ontology - presented in the paper "A Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development" submitted to [OWLED 2016](https://www.w3.org/community/owled/workshop-2016/) and available in [RASH](https://github.com/essepuntato/rash) at https://w3id.org/people/essepuntato/papers/samod-owled2016.html.

In particular:

* the file "all_data.xlsx" contains all the data gathered from the experiment, and includes the answers each user provided to the three questionnaires proposed (i.e. background knowledge questionnaire, SUS questionnaire, experience in using SAMOD questionnaire);

* the file "background.csv" contains the answers (in a 1-5 scale, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree) provided by the users to the first questionnaire;

* the file "sus.csv" contains the answers (in a 1-5 scale, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree) provided by the users to the second questionnaire;

* the file "data_ground_analysis_questionnaire_3" contains the ground analysis performed using the answers to the third questionnaire;

* the file "sus-vs-background.png" contains some graphs indicating the agreement between users' experience score calculated from the answers of the first questionnaire and the SUS score and its sub-scores (second questionnaire);

* the file "statistics.r" is an R script used for calculating the SUS and the agreement described in the aforementioned file.
