# SAMOD
*SAMOD*, the *Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development*, is a novel agile methodology for the development of ontologies by means of small steps of an iterative workflow that focuses on creating well-developed and documented models starting from exemplar domain descriptions.

The document describing the methodology is available in [HTML (RASH)](http://essepuntato.github.io/samod/), [PDF](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/samod/master/samod.pdf), [LaTeX](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/samod/master/samod.tex), and [ODT](https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/samod/master/samod.odt).
